SpecialAnnouncementの動機付けシナリオは<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic"">コロナウイルスパンデミック</a>であり、初期の語彙はこの緊急事態に焦点を当てています。Schema.orgは、マークアップが展開され、使用からのフィードバックが得られるにつれて反復的に改善することを期待しています。通常の<a href=""https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490"">Githubエントリ</a>に加えて、フィードバックコメントは<a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#"">このドキュメント</a>でも提供できます。<br/><br/>このスキーマは緊急危機関連情報を伝えるために設計されていますが、<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol"">CAP</a>のような緊急警告技術と同じではなく、重複する部分があるかもしれません。意図は、緊急事態中に既存のウェブサイトに投稿される日常的で実践的な情報をカバーすることです。<br/><br/>いくつかの種類の情報を提供できます：<br/><br/>「name」、「text」、「datePosted」、「expires」（適切な場合）、「category」、「url」をシンプルなベースラインとして提供することを推奨します。「category」の値を提供することは重要で、最も理想的にはWikipediaやWikidataからのよく知られたURLを使用します。2019-2020コロナウイルスパンデミックの場合、これは「https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic」または「https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910」であるべきです。<br/><br/>多くの可能なプロパティについて、値は要約が利用可能かどうかによってシンプルなリンクまたはインライン説明のいずれかになります。リンクの場合、適切なページのURLだけをプロパティの値として提供します。インライン説明の場合、<a class=""localLink"" href=""/WebContent"">WebContent</a>タイプを使用し、URLをそのプロパティとして提供し、少なくともシンプルな「<a class=""localLink"" href=""/text"">text</a>」要約を一緒に提供します。1つのSpecialAnnouncementがすべての可能なプロパティを同時に必要とする可能性は低いです。<br/><br/>多くの場合、参照されるページにはより専門的な構造化データ（例：連絡先情報、<a class=""localLink"" href=""/openingHours"">openingHours</a>、<a class=""localLink"" href=""/Event"">Event</a>、<a class=""localLink"" href=""/FAQPage"">FAQPage</a>など）が含まれると予想されます。<a class=""localLink"" href=""/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a>からそれらのページにリンクすることで、イベントが<a class=""localLink"" href=""/category"">category</a>プロパティで示される状況（例：コロナウイルス）に関連していることを明確にできます。<br/><br/>多くの<a class=""localLink"" href=""/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a>は特定の地域および識別可能なローカル組織に関連します。地域には<a class=""localLink"" href=""/spatialCoverage"">spatialCoverage</a>を使用し、特定の<a class=""localLink"" href=""/LocalBusiness"">LocalBusiness</a>や<a class=""localLink"" href=""/CivicStructure"">CivicStructure</a>を示すには<a class=""localLink"" href=""/announcementLocation"">announcementLocation</a>を使用します。アナウンスが特定の地域と特定の場所の両方に影響する場合（例えば、全体の地域にサービスを提供する図書館の閉鎖）、<a class=""localLink"" href=""/spatialCoverage"">spatialCoverage</a>と<a class=""localLink"" href=""/announcementLocation"">announcementLocation</a>の両方を使用します。<br/><br/><a class=""localLink"" href=""/about"">about</a>プロパティは、アナウンスの焦点であるエンティティを示すために使用できます。現在、<a class=""localLink"" href=""/about"">about</a>は場所でないエンティティ（例：<a class=""localLink"" href=""/Course"">Course</a>や<a class=""localLink"" href=""/RadioStation"">RadioStation</a>）を表すためだけに使用することを推奨します。場所には<a class=""localLink"" href=""/announcementLocation"">announcementLocation</a>と<a class=""localLink"" href=""/spatialCoverage"">spatialCoverage</a>を使用してください。このマークアップの消費者は、初期設計が場所にも/aboutを使用することを奨励していたことに注意する必要があります。<br/><br/><a class=""localLink""

href=""/webFeed"">webFeed</a>プロパティでフィードを指定できます。これは単純なURL、またはインラインの<a class=""localLink"" href=""/DataFeed"">DataFeed</a>オブジェクトで、<a class=""localLink""
