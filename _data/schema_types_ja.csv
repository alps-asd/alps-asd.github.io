シリーズの項目に適用可能なプロパティを、包含するグループに役立つ形で適用することは一般的です。Schema.orgはこれらのケースの一部を予測しようとしますが、出版社は、適切と思われる場合は、シリーズの構成要素のプロパティをシリーズ全体に適用しても構いません。","https://schema.org/CreativeWork, https://schema.org/Series",,,"https://schema.org/about, https://schema.org/abstract, https://schema.org/accessMode, https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient, https://schema.org/accessibilityAPI, https://schema.org/accessibilityControl, https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature, https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard, https://schema.org/accessibilitySummary, https://schema.org/accountablePerson, https://schema.org/acquireLicensePage, https://schema.org/additionalType, https://schema.org/aggregateRating, https://schema.org/alternateName, https://schema.org/alternativeHeadline, https://schema.org/assesses, https://schema.org/associatedMedia, https://schema.org/audience, https://schema.org/audio, https://schema.org/author, https://schema.org/award, https://schema.org/awards, https://schema.org/character, https://schema.org/citation, https://schema.org/comment, https://schema.org/commentCount, https://schema.org/conditionsOfAccess, https://schema.org/contentLocation, https://schema.org/contentRating, https://schema.org/contentReferenceTime, https://schema.org/contributor, https://schema.org/copyrightHolder, https://schema.org/copyrightNotice, https://schema.org/copyrightYear, https://schema.org/correction, https://schema.org/creativeWorkStatus, https://schema.org/creator, https://schema.org/creditText, https://schema.org/dateCreated, https://schema.org/dateModified, https://schema.org/datePublished, https://schema.org/description, https://schema.org/disambiguatingDescription, https://schema.org/discussionUrl, https://schema.org/editEIDR, https://schema.org/editor, https://schema.org/educationalAlignment, https://schema.org/educationalLevel, https://schema.org/educationalUse, https://schema.org/encoding, https://schema.org/encodingFormat, https://schema.org/encodings, https://schema.org/endDate, https://schema.org/exampleOfWork, https://schema.org/expires, https://schema.org/fileFormat, https://schema.org/funder, https://schema.org/genre, https://schema.org/hasPart, https://schema.org/headline, https://schema.org/identifier, https://schema.org/image, https://schema.org/inLanguage, https://schema.org/interactionStatistic, https://schema.org/interactivityType, https://schema.org/isAccessibleForFree, https://schema.org/isBasedOn, https://schema.org/isBasedOnUrl, https://schema.org/isFamilyFriendly, https://schema.org/isPartOf, https://schema.org/issn, https://schema.org/keywords, https://schema.org/learningResourceType, https://schema.org/license, https://schema.org/locationCreated, https://schema.org/mainEntity, https://schema.org/mainEntityOfPage, https://schema.org/maintainer, https://schema.org/material, https://schema.org/materialExtent, https://schema.org/mentions, https://schema.org/name, https://schema.org/offers, https://schema.org/pattern, https://schema.org/position, https://schema.org/potentialAction, https://schema.org/producer, https://schema.org/provider, https://schema.org/publication, https://schema.org/publisher, https://schema.org/publisherImprint, https://schema.org/publishingPrinciples, https://schema.org/recordedAt, https://schema.org/releasedEvent, https://schema.org/review, https://schema.org/reviews, https://schema.org/sameAs, https://schema.org/schemaVersion, https://schema.org/sdDatePublished, https://schema.org/sdLicense, https://schema.org/sdPublisher, https://schema.org/size, https://schema.org/sourceOrganization, https://schema.org/spatial, https://schema.org/spatialCoverage, https://schema.org/sponsor, https://schema.org/startDate, https://schema.org/subjectOf, https://schema.org/teaches, https://schema.org/temporal, https://schema.org/temporalCoverage, https://schema.org/text, https://schema.org/thumbnailUrl, https://schema.org/timeRequired, https://schema.org/translationOfWork, https://schema.org/translator, https://schema.org/typicalAgeRange, https://schema.org/url, https://schema.org/usageInfo, https://schema.org/version, https://schema.org/video, https://schema.org/workExample, https://schema.org/workTranslation","https://schema.org/BookSeries, https://schema.org/MovieSeries, https://schema.org/Periodical, https://schema.org/PodcastSeries, https://schema.org/RadioSeries, https://schema.org/TVSeries, https://schema.org/VideoGameSeries",,,

https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement,SpecialAnnouncement,"A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update
      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a
      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,
      local government.<br/><br/>

For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#"">this doc</a>.<br/><br/>

The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic"">Coronavirus pandemic</a>, and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org
expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our
usual <a href=""https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490"">Github entry</a>, feedback comments can also be provided in <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#"">this document</a>.<br/><br/>

While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol"">CAP</a>, although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover
the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.<br/><br/>

Several kinds of information can be provided:<br/><br/>

We encourage the provision of ""name"", ""text"", ""datePosted"", ""expires"" (if appropriate), ""category"" and
""url"" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for ""category"" where possible, most ideally as a well known
URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be ""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic"" or ""https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910"".<br/><br/>

For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a <a class=""localLink"" href=""/WebContent"">WebContent</a> type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple ""<a class=""localLink"" href=""/text"">text</a>"" summary of the page. It is
unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.<br/><br/>

We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/openingHours"">openingHours</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/Event"">Event</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/FAQPage"">FAQPage</a> etc. By linking to those pages from a <a class=""localLink"" href=""/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a> you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the <a class=""localLink"" href=""/category"">category</a> property of the <a class=""localLink"" href=""/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a>.<br/><br/>

Many <a class=""localLink"" href=""/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a>s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use <a class=""localLink"" href=""/spatialCoverage"">spatialCoverage</a> for the region, and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/announcementLocation"">announcementLocation</a> to indicate specific <a class=""localLink"" href=""/LocalBusiness"">LocalBusiness</a>es and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/CivicStructure"">CivicStructure</a>s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both <a class=""localLink"" href=""/spatialCoverage"">spatialCoverage</a> and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/announcementLocation"">announcementLocation</a>.<br/><br/>

The <a class=""localLink"" href=""/about"">about</a> property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using <a class=""localLink"" href=""/about"">about</a> only
for representing non-location entities (e.g. a <a class=""localLink"" href=""/Course"">Course</a> or a <a class=""localLink"" href=""/RadioStation"">RadioStation</a>). For places, use <a class=""localLink"" href=""/announcementLocation"">announcementLocation</a> and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/spatialCoverage"">spatialCoverage</a>. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of /about for locations too.<br/><br/>

The basic content of <a class=""localLink"" href=""/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a> is similar to that of an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS"">RSS</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)"">Atom</a> feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting
<a class=""localLink"" href=""/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a> updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed
with the <a class=""localLink"" href=""/webFeed"">webFeed</a> property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline <a class=""localLink"" href=""/DataFeed"">DataFeed</a> object, with <a class=""localLink"" href=""/encodingFormat"">encodingFormat</a> providing
media type information e.g. ""application/rss+xml"" or ""application/atom+xml"".

https://schema.org/SuperficialAnatomy,SuperficialAnatomy,解剖学的な特徴のうち、解剖なしで視覚的に観察できるもの。これには、人体の形態と比例、そしてより深部の皮下構造に対応する表面のランドマークが含まれます。表面解剖学は、スポーツ医学、採血、その他の医療分野において重要な役割を果たします。なぜなら、表面触診によって基礎となる解剖学的構造を特定できるからです。例えば、背中手術の際、表面解剖学を用いて椎骨を触診・数え、切開部位を特定することができます。あるいは、採血においては、表面解剖学を用いて基礎となる静脈の位置を特定することができます。例えば、上腕静脈は、肘窩の境界（上腕骨内上顆や外上顆など）を触診し、静脈の大きさ、隆起、圧迫後の再充填能力、周囲組織の支持感などの表在的な兆候を探すことで見つけることができます。別の例として、肩関節の亜脱臼（脱臼）の場合、三角筋が肩関節を覆いきれず、肩甲骨の縁が表面的に可視になります。ここでは、表面解剖学とは可視化された肩甲骨の縁であり、これは基礎となる関節の脱臼（関連する解剖学的構造）を示唆しています。,https://schema.org/MedicalEntity,,,"https://schema.org/additionalType, https://schema.org/alternateName, https://schema.org/associatedPathophysiology, https://schema.org/code, https://schema.org/description, https://schema.org/disambiguatingDescription, https://schema.org/guideline, https://schema.org/identifier, https://schema.org/image, https://schema.org/legalStatus, https://schema.org/mainEntityOfPage, https://schema.org/medicineSystem, https://schema.org/name, https://schema.org/potentialAction, https://schema.org/recognizingAuthority, https://schema.org/relatedAnatomy, https://schema.org/relatedCondition, https://schema.org/relatedTherapy, https://schema.org/relevantSpecialty, https://schema.org/sameAs, https://schema.org/significance, https://schema.org/study, https://schema.org/subjectOf, https://schema.org/url",,,,
