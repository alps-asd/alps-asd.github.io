# Introduction

![ASD](https://alps-asd.github.io/app-state-diagram/blog/profile.svg)


## ALPS: A format for clarifying application-level semantics and structure

ALPS (Application-Level Profile Semantics) is a format that defines the semantics and relationships between application data and functionality. ALPS makes it easier to document and share application data structures and possible behaviors.

## ASD: Visualization of Application State Transitions

ASD (Application State Diagram) is a tool for visualizing application state transitions and behaviors generated from ALPS documents. By using this tool, you can get a bird's eye view of the overall structure of your application and intuitively grasp the transitions between states and possible actions.

## Use: Information Architecture for REST Application Design

ALPS and ASD can be used to design REST applications from an information architecture perspective without UI/UX design. The defined vocabularies and link structures provide a basis for shared understanding among development teams and facilitate consistent application development.

These tools aid the design and implementation process by clarifying the structure and behavior of the application; ALPS-ASD is intended to enhance the understanding of semantics and state management in web application development.
