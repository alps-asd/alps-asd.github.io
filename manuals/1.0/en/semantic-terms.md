# Recommended Semantic Terms

## Overview

This document provides a complete list of terms from [Schema.org](https://schema.org) vocabulary that can be used as semantic descriptors (id) in ALPS profiles.

### Usage

1. When starting API design, first select appropriate terms from 🔵 Core Terms.
2. If more detailed expression is needed, consider 🟡 Extended Terms.
3. For special use cases, consider ⚪ Full Terms.
4. You can find terms by category using the category index.
5. Regarding domain-specific terms:
- Define industry or business-specific terms as custom semantic descriptors
- Naming convention: domainName + PropertyName (e.g., orderShippingStatus, medicalDiagnosisCode)
- It is recommended to build on Schema.org terms while making necessary extensions
- When defining domain-specific terms, it's important to clearly document their meaning and usage
